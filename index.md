[Aggie Experts](https://dev.experts.ucdavis.edu) is a joint pilot project between the Office of the Provost and the UC Davis Library. Its purpose is to create a central registry of UC Davis scholarship produced by faculty, researchers, experts and creators. Aggie Experts can be used as an expertise discovery platform for finding collaborators, mentors and expert opinions, as a showcase of the UC Davis excellence in research, teaching and community service, and as a tool that reduces the administrative load on UC Davis researchers and administrators. In the course of two years (2020-2022) we will be expanding the registry by adding faculty from the College of Engineering and adjusting its functionality based on user feedback.

## Data Sources for Aggie Experts

* We use the UC Davis identity management system as the source for the scholar’s name, title and unit affiliation. Researchers can change that information in the campus directory listing.
* Publications metadata is based on scholars’ claims of publications in support of the UC Open Access Policy. Faculty can review with publications they have claimed, and what additional publications are pending review and approval in the California Digital Library instance of Symplectic Elements publication management system.
* Research subject areas are generated in one of the following manners:
- The researcher has already selected relevant keywords in the Symplectic Elements publication management system
- The keywords are extracted from the researchers’ claimed publications, and the ones that occur three or more times are added to their profiles.



## Software used by the Application

Aggie Experts is inspired by the [VIVO software
tool](https://duraspace.org/vivo/about/) and uses their schema in the
description of research data.  In addition, exports of the Aggie data will be
made available in the VIVO schema.

Aggie Experts uses some data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). In
particular, Aggie Experts uses data available in Wikidata for the campus
colleges, departments and campus structure.  The UC Davis Library helps maintain
the campus departments.
