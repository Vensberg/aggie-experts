# Overview
[Aggie Experts](https://dev.experts.ucdavis.edu) is a joint pilot project between the Office of the Provost and the UC Davis Library. Its purpose is to create a central registry of UC Davis scholarship produced by faculty, researchers, experts and creators. Aggie Experts can be used as an expertise discovery platform for finding collaborators, mentors and expert opinions, as a showcase of the UC Davis excellence in research, teaching and community service, and as a tool that reduces the administrative load on UC Davis researchers and administrators. In the course of two years (2020-2022) we will be expanding the registry by adding faculty from the College of Engineering and adjusting its functionality based on user feedback.

## Software used by the Application

Aggie Experts is inspired by the [VIVO software
tool](https://duraspace.org/vivo/about/) and uses their schema in the
description of research data.  In addition, exports of the Aggie data will be
made available in the VIVO schema.

Aggie Experts uses some data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). In
particular, Aggie Experts uses data available in Wikidata for the campus
colleges, departments and campus structure.  The UC Davis Library helps maintain
