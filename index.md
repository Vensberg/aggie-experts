## Data Used by Aggie Experts

Users own their data.

## Software used by the Application

Aggie Experts is inspired by the [VIVO software
tool](https://duraspace.org/vivo/about/) and uses their schema in the
description of research data.  In addition, exports of the Aggie data will be
made available in the VIVO schema.

Aggie Experts uses some data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). In
particular, Aggie Experts uses data available in Wikidata for the campus
colleges, departments and campus structure.  The UC Davis Library helps maintain
the campus departments.
